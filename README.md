# SE2222-Term-Project

Our goal was to choose one topic and design database management system for it.

I decided to design a hospital management system. 


A hospital management system is a web-based medical management platform that collects and integrates data from all departments in order to automate internal processes. 
At its core, hospital management system aims to simplify the workflow for clinicians, reduce administrative costs, diminish errors, and provide a better patient experience. Since the system handles every part of the hospital, it encompasses a vast range of functions. It accumulates hospitals, doctors, patients, nurses, medical records, appointments and payment.
